CS 111 Lab 1:

1a:
For reading in the command, we created a token stream which tokenized based on different types.
Then we validated the token stream before converting the tokens into the corresponding command trees;
To create command trees, we used 2 stacks to sort through operators and words/simple commands. Depending
on the precedence of the operator as well as certain corner cases, we either pushed the operator onto the stack
or combined it with words to create a simple command. We stored the command trees into command_stream as a linked list,
which was traversed in read_command_stream.
