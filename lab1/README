CS 111 Lab 1:

1a:
We used the built in function pointer for get_next_byte to read the whole script into a buffer that
can reallocate if needed. For reading in the command, we created a token stream which tokenized based
on the 8 special tokens in the spec as well as backticks. The token stream contained a linked list of tokens
and the type of the token (e.g WORD token, AND_OR token) Then we validated the token stream before converting
the tokens into the corresponding command trees by confirming that the next token type is valid to appear after
the current token being processed. In the validate function, we also truncated extra spaces and newlines

To create command trees, we used 2 stacks to sort through operators and words/simple commands. Depending
on the precedence of the operator as well as certain corner cases, we either pushed the operator onto the stack
or combined it with words to create a simple command. We stored the command trees into command_stream as a linked list,
which was traversed in read_command_stream.

To our knowledge, there are no limitations to our design. Malloced blocks are reallocated if they can possibly grow, and
all special tokens and trailing whitespace are accounted for.
