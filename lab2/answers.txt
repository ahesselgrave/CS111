Note from Alex:
I ran our code on both Windows 8.1 64-bit VMWare Player and VirtualBox using the cs111-35.iso as the install disk.
For some reason, on my machine test cases 6 and 15 will only sometimes work, and 16 and 17 always fail.
However, on Kristen's OSX Yosemite Virtualbox, all the cases run flawlessly. I went as far as SFTPing her files over to
my instance and running again, yet I got the same issue while her instance was flawless. We can't see any strange race conditions
in the code (and regardless shouldn't they be consistent throughout the CS111 distro?). No idea why this happens, but it is something
to consider when testing our code.

UPDATE:
I copied her VM harddrive file over to my Windows version and tried to run and got the same results. I don't know what the problem is.
Here's the code anyways. Have fun
